h1. Installation

Remember, the FORTRAN version of AmpFit is contained solely within the fortran/ directory, including any IDL rouintes for plotting results, which are in the fortran/idl/ directory.

h2. Downloading

bc. git clone git@github.com:dlg0/ampereFit.git

h2. Libraries

There are several libraries that the ampFit fortran library depends on. These are:

* "The GNU Scientific Library":http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
* "FGSL: A Fortran interface to the GNU Scientific Library":http://www.lrz.de/services/software/mathematik/gsl/fortran/
* "LAPACK":http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
* Blas, of which I suggest "GotoBLAS2":http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2/
Note: building gotoblas2 on the AMPRE machine requires the TARGET=NEHALEM flag.
Note: the GotoBLAS2 libary is causing a segfault on the AMPRE machine. Not sure why yet.
* "LAPACK95":http://www.netlib.org/lapack95/
* "NetCDF":http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

You will need to install these and then modify the following lines of "Makefile":

bc. NETCDF_DIR = /opt/local
F95_LAPACK_DIR = /Users/dg6/code/lapack95/LAPACK95
LAPACK_DIR = /Users/dg6/code/lapack/lapack-3.3.0
BLAS_DIR = /Users/dg6/code/gotoBLAS/GotoBLAS2
GSL_DIR = /Users/dg6/code/ampereFit/fortran/gsl
FGSL_DIR = /Users/dg6/code/ampereFit/fortran/fgsl

h2. Compiler

At present I have only compiled with gfortran. You will need to specify the location of your gfortran in @Makefile@ at the following locations:

bc. F90 = /opt/local/bin/gfortran-mp-4.4
F77 = /opt/local/bin/gfortran-mp-4.4

If you want to change to something other than gfortran further modifications will need to be made and you had best let me do it ;) 

h2. Building

Should be pretty straigh forward:

@make@
